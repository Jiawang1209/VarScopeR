Description: VarScopeR provides a variance-based framework for identifying perturbation-driven feature modules by decomposing within- and between-group variance. 
             The package integrates feature-centric variance decomposition, dimensionality reduction, and graph-based community detection to reveal coherent response patterns across experimental conditions.
