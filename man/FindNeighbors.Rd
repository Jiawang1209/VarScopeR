\usage{
FindNeighbors(
  object,
  reduction = "pca",
  dims = 1:10,
  k.param = 20,
  compute.SNN = TRUE,
  prune.SNN = 1/15,
  graph.name = NULL,
  seed = 1115
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{VarScope} object containing PCA or other reduction results.}

\item{reduction}{Character. Name of the reduction to use (default: "pca").}

\item{dims}{Integer vector. Which dimensions to use from the reduction
(default: 1:10).}

\item{k.param}{Integer. Number of nearest neighbors to find (default: 20).}

\item{compute.SNN}{Logical. Whether to compute the shared nearest neighbor
(SNN) graph (default: TRUE).}

\item{prune.SNN}{Numeric. Sets the cutoff for acceptable Jaccard index when
computing the neighborhood overlap for the SNN construction (default: 1/15).}

\item{graph.name}{Character. Prefix for graph names (default: NULL, uses
reduction name).}

\item{seed}{Integer. Random seed for reproducibility (default: 1115).}
}
\value{
A \code{VarScope} object with graphs stored in \code{object$graphs}.
  The graphs represent ASV-ASV similarities and include:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{knn}: K-nearest neighbor graph (ASVs × ASVs)
    \item \code{snn}: Shared nearest neighbor graph (ASVs × ASVs, if compute.SNN = TRUE)
  }
}
\description{
Construct K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and shared nearest neighbor (SNN) graphs
based on PCA results or other dimensional reductions. These graphs are used
for subsequent ASV clustering analysis. The graphs represent similarities
between ASVs based on their abundance patterns.
