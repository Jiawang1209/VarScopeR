\title{Identify variable features by variance decomposition in VarScope object}
\usage{
FindVariableFeatures(
  object,
  assay = "norm",
  var_within_cutoff = 0.4,
  var_between_cutoff = 0.5,
  seed = 1115,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{VarScope} object containing normalized feature abundance data.}

\item{assay}{Character. Name of the assay to use for variable feature detection
(default: "norm").}

\item{var_within_cutoff}{Numeric. Quantile threshold for within-group variance.
Features with within-group variance below this quantile are retained
(default: 0.4, i.e., bottom 40%).}

\item{var_between_cutoff}{Numeric. Lower threshold for between-group variance
proportion (eta2_between). Features with eta2_between >= this value are
retained (default: 0.5).}

\item{seed}{Integer. Random seed for reproducibility (default: 1115).}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Whether to print progress messages (default: TRUE).}
}
\value{
A \code{VarScope} object with variable feature information stored in:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{object$features$stats}: Statistics for all features
    \item \code{object$features$stats_filter}: Filtered variable features
    \item \code{object$features$variable}: Character vector of variable feature names
  }
}
\description{
Identify perturbation-driven variable features by decomposing feature-wise
variance into within-group and between-group components. Features showing
low within-group variability and high between-group variability are retained
as variable features.
